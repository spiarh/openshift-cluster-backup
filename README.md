Environment Variables

By default, the SDK detects AWS credentials set in your environment and uses them to sign requests to AWS. That way you donâ€™t need to manage credentials in your applications.

The SDK looks for credentials in the following environment variables:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)
